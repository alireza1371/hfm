# hfm (High Frequency Monitor)

hfm is an application to run tests in parallel at a high frequency. If the
outcome of the test results in a state change, other commands can be executed.

It is designed to be a general purpose tool, by having both the tests and the
state change commands be interpereted by a shell, such as /bin/sh.

An example application is to poll other network services for health, and to
take actions based on their health status changes.

## Building

There's a patch-local-go-libucl make target that will allow you to use the 
locally installed libucl vs. a vendorized version.
